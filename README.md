CentHORD: Centromere Higher Order Repeat Detector

CentHORD is a tool for the detection of dimeric or generic Higher Order repeats (HOR)  in alpha satellite regions (centromeres).

## Features:
- Diagonal detection with optional merging of nearby fragments.
- Checkerboard detection using normalized cross-correlation (NCC).
- Fusion of overlapping/adjacent checkerboard blocks into larger zones.
- Outputs CSVs for diagonals and checkerboard zones.
- Plots a heatmap with:
    - Non-overlapping diagonals annotated
    - Checkerboard zones highlighted
    - A barplot of NCC scores above the heatmap
